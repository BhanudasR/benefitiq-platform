# BenefitIQ Platform — Pilot Production (Sprint 0 foundation)

Production foundation for the BenefitIQ **Data Onboarding & Trust Engine**. Sprint 0
is foundation only — **no dashboards, no AI, no analytics, no renewal UI, no engines yet.**

Production principles (enforced from day one):
- No dashboard before trusted data · no analytics before canonical data · no AI before governed facts.
- **Raw data is immutable** (content-addressed, hashed, write-once). Corrections are overlays.
- Every upload/correction/revalidation/activation is auditable. Backend calculates official numbers; the UI never does.

## Stack
React+TS (frontend, later) · Python **FastAPI** · **PostgreSQL** (canonical + governance + audit) ·
S3-compatible object storage (**MinIO**/AWS Mumbai) for immutable raw files · JWT + RBAC + tenant isolation.

## Run (local)
```bash
cd infra && docker compose up -d postgres minio        # Postgres + MinIO
cd ../backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
cp ../.env.example ../.env
uvicorn app.main:app --reload                            # http://localhost:8000/docs
pytest -q                                                # unit tests (no external services)
```

## What Sprint 0 delivers
- Immutable raw upload + SHA-256 hashing (`services/storage.py`, `api/routes_upload.py`).
- Canonical + governance schema aligned to IRDAI **F15** and the BenefitIQ v2 data dictionaries
  (`models/canonical.py`, `models/governance.py`, `canonical/registry.py`).
- Audit-log baseline (append-only) and Auth/RBAC skeleton (ADMIN>REVIEWER>ANALYST, tenant-scoped).
- Masked sample fixtures (`fixtures/`) and unit tests (`backend/tests/`).

## SOURCE OF TRUTH & REFERENCES
**This repository (`benefitiq-platform/`) is the single production source of truth for BenefitIQ.**

- The earlier **Codex** repository and its commits (through `139acf3 Sprint 2 Step 8B: policy and
  member canonical loaders`) are **archived / reference only**. This codebase does **not** depend on
  Codex, does not reconcile against it, and does not copy Codex code unless explicitly instructed.
- The earlier **demo UI** (`BenefitIQ_Demo.html` and its React `.js` sources in the parent folder)
  is a **UX/visual reference only** — it is not production code, carries no production data, and none
  of its hard-coded demo values are used here. Official numbers are computed by this backend.

Governing sources for all schema and logic: the **IRDAI F15 / IIB** health data dictionaries, the
**BenefitIQ v2** data dictionaries, the **BenefitIQ Master Context**, and the approved **Pilot
Production MVP roadmap**. See `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## What Sprint 1 delivers — Data Onboarding, Validation & Data Quality Score
Sprint 1 adds the governed onboarding pipeline (still no dashboards / no analytics KPIs):

- **Profiling** (`services/tabular.py`, `services/profiling.py`) — decode raw CSV/TSV,
  detect the header row (skips TPA title/preamble rows), per-column dtype/null/distinct/samples.
- **Mapping engine** (`services/mapping.py`) — synonym + fuzzy suggestion of canonical fields,
  per-field and mandatory-weighted overall confidence, reviewer confirm, layout-signature
  **profile reuse**, plus `MappingProfile` model.
- **Validation engine** (`services/validation.py`) — required / type / code-master / business-rule
  checks; field classification **Critical / Important / Optional** (from the registry) mapped to
  **Error / Warning / Info**; governed nuance (an Outstanding claim with no paid amount is INFO, not
  a false error).
- **Data Quality Score** (`services/dq_score.py`) — 8 weighted components with a reconciling
  **explainability object** (`sum(weighted_points) == overall_score`), readiness bands
  (≥85 Analytics Ready · 70–84 Conditional · <70 Not Reliable), and top gaps.
- **Quarantine / review queue** (`services/quarantine.py`) — row-level split (never file-level);
  quarantined rows carry their issues + a proposed correction action.
- **API** (`api/routes_onboarding.py`) — `/onboarding/profile`, `/mapping/suggest`,
  `/mapping/confirm` (REVIEWER+), `/mapping/reuse`, `/validate`, `/dq-score` (full pipeline).

Principle enforced: **no dashboard before trusted data, no analytics before canonical data.** A low
score never blocks raw upload — it blocks *blind* analytics and shows exactly what to fix.

## What Sprint 2 delivers — Persistence, Correction & Governed Canonical Load
Sprint 2 turns the Sprint 1 engines into a durable, audited lifecycle (still no dashboards / AI / KPIs):

- **Persistent onboarding lifecycle** (`services/onboarding_service.py`): upload → mapping → validate
  → dq → correct → revalidate → approve → activate/override → load. Every step persists artifacts,
  writes an `AuditLog` row, and is tenant-scoped. Raw is re-materialised from immutable bytes +
  confirmed mapping + correction overlays — **never mutated**.
- **Persistence** of `MappingProfile`, `ValidationIssue`, `ReviewItem` (review queue), `DQResult`,
  `DatasetVersion`, `CorrectionOverlay`, `OverrideRecord`.
- **Two-gate canonical load** (`services/gate.py`, `services/canonical_loader.py`):
  - Row-level: CRITICAL rows are quarantined and **never** loaded; warn/info load with caveats.
  - Dataset-level: DQ ≥85 → Analytics Ready (Reviewer approval); 70–84 → Conditional (Reviewer
    approval, KPI caveats); <70 → blocked, **Admin override only** → Restricted (mandatory reason +
    full audit; never loads critical rows; downstream advisory outputs stay blocked/caveated).
- **Idempotent claims + bill-component loader skeleton** — writes only clean rows from an ACTIVE
  version, propagating `data_quality_caveat` + `restricted` onto every canonical row.
- **Alembic** migration baseline for the full schema (`migrations/`), plus dev startup auto-create.
- Batch-scoped API (`api/routes_batches.py`); 66 tests (SQLite-backed), including tenant isolation,
  audit-per-transition, override rules, and loader idempotency.

*Not in scope (future):* analytics/KPIs, ICR, Renewal simulation, dashboards, AI Copilot — no
analytics is computed in Sprint 2; this is the trusted-data foundation those will consume.
